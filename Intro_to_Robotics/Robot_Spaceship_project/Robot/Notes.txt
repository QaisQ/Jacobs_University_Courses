My answer is in Make_MyRobot.m:

I followed the methods shown in the make_scara_robot file, while refering to the used functions so I could know what each takes as input and gives for output.

Then what was needed is to simply assemble the parts made, following the same joints method shown, and only changing the translation to make the links line up as wanted.

And I managed to implement different shapes (Sphere, cylinder, rectangle), and change their dimensions and colors and orientation in space.
